 ***My Projects***

| Repository | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [**Titanomachy**](https://github.com/Ferjodios/cripto-p1) | ‚öîÔ∏è Titanomachy is an asynchronous turn-based RPG where players register, choose their characters, and battle. The twist? All attack names are encrypted to maintain secrecy and fairness. Players can attack, defend, or heal during their turn. The game is built using Tkinter and it ensures secure authentication and encrypted communication with players. |
| [**John The Ripper Craking Passwords Analisys**](https://github.com/DavidY343/ciber_p1_jtr) | üîê In this project, we focus on password cracking using John the Ripper. The repository highlights our analysis of results, where we successfully cracked over 80,000 MD5-hashed passwords and more than 15,000 passwords hashed with bcrypt using 10 rounds, employing various attack modes and strategies for efficient cracking. |
| [**A Star Algorithm**](https://github.com/DavidY343/CSP-and-A-start-algorithm) | üöë In this project, I implemented the A* heuristic algorithm and explored different heuristic models, including brute force, Manhattan distance, and Euclidean distance, to optimize pathfinding. The goal was to compare the performance and accuracy of various heuristics in solving search problems. |
| [**Distributed Communication with RPC and Web Services**](https://github.com/DavidY343/SSDD_final) | üñß In this project, we implement a distributed system using RPC, Socket, and Web Services. It enables efficient client-server communication with RPC for structured operations, sockets for real-time requests like file retrieval and user management, and a simple SOAP web service to provide the current time. |
| [**Mongo DB Migration Process**](https://github.com/DavidY343/arquidatos) | üõ†Ô∏è In this project, we focus on performing ETL processes on a dirty database, transforming it into a clean version. The cleaned data is then uploaded to MongoDB, where we implement preprocessing, validation schemas, and aggregations to ensure efficient and structured data management. |
| [**42 Madrid Curriculum Journey**](https://github.com/DavidY343/42_swap) | üåç This project reflects my journey through the 42 Madrid curriculum, where I‚Äôve tackled challenges across a wide range of topics including C programming, algorithms, Unix systems, web development, databases, and DevOps. Through peer-to-peer learning and project-based tasks, I‚Äôve developed technical skills and a problem-solving mindset, fostering creativity and collaboration. |
